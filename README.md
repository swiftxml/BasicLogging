# BasicLogging

This is a small multi-platform logging library.

This logging library was specifically designed to allow users to quickly get started with the [Pipeline](https://github.com/swiftxml/Pipeline) library. However, it can also be used independently of the Pipeline library.

In order to use this library with the Pipeline libary, you also need the [PipelineBasicLogging](https://github.com/swiftxml/PipelineBasicLogging) library which implements a binding to the Pipeline library. It suffices to then add the PipelineBasicLogging libary as a dependency.
